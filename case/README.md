What it is: a two-piece snap-fit box for exactly our stack, Pico plugged into the Pico-LCD-1.3.
Both halves are in the one STL, side by side. Closed box about 60 x 34 x 26 mm.

- Lid: screen window, a slot the four bare A/B/X/Y buttons poke through, a diamond hole the
  joystick stem pokes through. No caps, you press the parts directly. That is the honest state of
  the art for this board: nobody has published floating caps for it.
- End: micro-USB slot (the Pico 2 W is micro-USB, not USB-C).
- Base: four M2 posts for the Pico, optional.
- Print: 0.2 mm layers, no supports (author says a small one under the USB cutout is optional).

Fit risk for us: the ATECC breakout and the four wedged wires live in the 11 mm gap between the
boards, inside the box footprint, so they should be fine. The wires leave the header at the USB end
and bend into the gap; keep them flat. Print it and see.

## v1: our own

Generate from Python (like the CELL parts) so it re-fits when parts change. Wants:
- floating caps for A/B/X/Y and a joystick hat, captured by the lid
- pocket for the ATECC breakout and a 502030 LiPo + charger
- USB cutout, maybe a lanyard hole

Board facts for that: Pico-LCD-1.3 is 52.0 x 26.5 mm, display 23.4 x 23.4 mm active. Waveshare
wiki: https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/Pico-LCD-1.3. A CAD model of the board exists on GrabCAD:
https://grabcad.com/library/waveshare-1-3-inch-lcd-for-pico-65k-240x240-1. Button and joystick
centers still need measuring with calipers.

## Buttons and joystick: research (2026-09-05)

Nobody has published caps for the Pico-LCD-1.3. But its Pi HAT twin (Waveshare 1.3inch LCD HAT,
same 240x240 panel, same 5-way joystick, same tact switches, 3 buttons instead of 4) is the
SeedSigner bitcoin wallet's screen, and that project has years of open enclosures with printed caps:

- SeedSigner enclosures, MIT: https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner/tree/dev/enclosures
  Copies of the parts that matter are in `reference/seedsigner/`:
  - `orange_pill_button.stl` 11.7 x 4.7 x 4.8 mm, `orange_pill_joystick.stl` 13 x 13 x 10 mm.
    Author says the thumbstick is clumsy and wants resin.
  - `open_pill_mini_w_coverplate_Buttons.stl` (three caps on a sprue, 20 mm tall), `Thumbstick_PLA`
    and `Thumbstick_TPU` (11.8 x 11.8 x 5.6 mm). FDM-only, TPU for the controls, no hardware.
- revetuzo's Open Pill caps, CC BY-SA: https://www.printables.com/model/179924
  Sticks and pads in 12/14/15 mm with a 2.05 mm square socket, "fits the 2 mm stick on the
  Waveshare HAT". Plus a glue-on button.
- Crackedconsole's HAT case with 3 buttons + joystick cap v2, Sketchup source:
  https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3334127. Note: 0.1 mm more clearance per button was too loose.
- Adafruit 4697 rubber nubbin cap, $0.50, fits the classic 5-way nav stem. Zero-effort option.
- The joystick family: ALPS SKQU (10 mm square, 4-way + center push). Datasheet: SMD center-push
  type is 8.6 mm tall overall, stem 3.2 mm square, 2.8 mm above the housing, travel 0.4 mm tilt /
  0.2 mm push, 1.57 N tilt / 3.14 N push. Waveshare's part is a clone; SeedSigner people measure
  the stem at 2 mm square, so measure ours.
- General cap design: https://www.printables.com/model/236991 (tact cap with assembly template),
  https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1557650, Apple's button patents. Same idea every time.

## How we will do it

Caps are loose parts trapped between the lid and the board. Nothing glued, nothing on the board.

```
        cap top (visible, any color)          ___
   lid  ======|   |======   <- hole in lid   |   |  lid hole = cap body + 0.25 mm/side
   flange  ___|   |___      <- wider than    |___|  flange 1.0 mm out, 1.0 mm thick
   post       |___|         the hole         | | |  post lands on the tact plunger
   board  ----[tact]----
```

- A/B/X/Y caps: round or square top 6 mm, flange 8 mm, post the size of the plunger. Cap body
  height = lid thickness + stand-off so the flange sits 0.3 mm above the plunger at rest, and
  bottoms on the lid underside just after the click (over-travel stop).
- Joystick hat: a 12 mm dome with a square socket that press-fits the stem (start at stem + 0.05 mm,
  like revetuzo's 2.05 mm), flange under a 13 mm lid hole so it can tilt 0.4 mm each way. A ring on
  the lid underside keeps it from lifting off. TPU hat is the comfy version.
- Lid holes get a 0.5 mm skirt under them so caps can't rock.
- Print caps top-face down on a textured plate for a clean face. Any color per cap.
- Generator: Python (CadQuery or OpenSCAD), parameters = the caliper numbers below.

Numbers we need from calipers, with the stack assembled:
1. Tact switch: plunger diameter, plunger height above the LCD PCB, switch body size (6x6?).
2. Joystick: stem width (square?), stem height above the metal housing, housing size, housing height
   above the PCB.
3. Height from LCD PCB top to the top of the screen glass.
4. Centers (x, y in mm): joystick + 4 buttons, measured from the PCB corner at the USB end
   (or a straight-down photo with a ruler in it).
5. The v0 case lid thickness at the button slot, once printed.

## Measurements (2026-09-05, v0 case on the bench)

From the v0 lid STL (the author's cutouts fit the board, photo in the build log), so these are
positions we can trust. Case outer 57 x 31 x 26 mm, lid plate 2.0 mm thick. Board center = case
center. x runs along the long side, + toward the buttons, 0 at the board center; y across, 0 on
the centerline.

| feature | in the lid | relative to board center |
|---|---|---|
| screen window | 30 x 27 mm | center x +2.0 |
| button slot | 4.5 x 21 mm | column at x +22.25, buttons at y ≈ -7.75, -2.6, +2.6, +7.75 (pitch ≈ 5.17) |
| joystick hole | 10 x 10 mm diamond (7.1 mm square rotated 45°) | center x -19.5 |

Calipers (Austin): 30.94 = case base width; 4.55 = tact switch body (4.5 mm square); 5.15 and
4.18 and 2.04 = see BUTTONS.md, being confirmed.

## Zez0000 case with caps (2026-09-08)

`case/zez0000/`: [Raspberry Pi Pico 2 Case - Waveshare 1.3" LCD by Zez0000](https://makerworld.com/en/models/3230142-raspberry-pi-pico-2-case-waveshare-1-3-lcd),
CC BY-NC, released 2026-08-28. A remix of the v0 case with 4 button caps and a joystick cap
already modeled: same base, rounded corners, square lid holes. Found while looking for a case
with the buttons and joystick covered. Parts: base 57x31x13, lid 57x31x15.6, button caps
6.3x5.5x4.4 (x4), joystick cap 8.2 round x4.1. Author settings: PLA, 0.20 mm, 2 walls, 15%
infill, no supports, about 40 min, caps on their own plate for a second color.
Print inbox drops `20260908-224447-*` and `20260908-224448-*`. Untested by us.

### base_v2 (2026-09-09): the stock base would not snap in

Austin printed the set; lid and base would not click together even with force. Measured on the
STLs: each base tab (53 x 2 mm, 2 mm above the rim) carries a full-length half-round ridge, r 0.5,
0.44 mm proud of the lid's inner wall, with zero end clearance. The lid has a matching r 0.5
groove centred 1.5 mm inside its mouth. That is 0.44 mm of interference along 106 mm at once.
`tools/zezbase` builds `case/zez0000/base_v3.stl`: ridge removed, tab face shaved to 0.1 mm
clearance, tab ends 0.25 mm clearance, then four 10 mm ridges (r 0.4, 0.25 mm proud) at
x = +-16 on each side, same height as the stock ridge so they land in the lid groove. Base only;
the stock lid and caps stay. v3 adds an 8 x 1 x 1 mm pry notch in the outer wall at the rim, +y side, x centre. Print inbox drop `20260909-*-base_v3`; full set in yellow PLA requested.

### base_v4 (2026-09-10): shorter posts, shorter case

The four Pico posts were 5.5 mm tall (floor z 2 to 7.5); Austin wants 3 mm, just enough to keep
BOOTSEL and the underside parts off the floor. `tools/zezbase` now also removes a 2.5 mm slab of
wall and post right above the floor and drops everything above it, so the USB slot, tabs, ridges
and pry notch keep their positions relative to the Pico. Output `case/zez0000/base_v4.stl`,
57 x 31 x 10.5 mm (was 13). Lid and caps unchanged. Print inbox drop `20260910-163347-base_v4`,
PLA fit check, base only. Knobs: `POST_H` (3.0) in `tools/zezbase`; `DROP` follows from it.

### joystick_cap_v2 (2026-09-10): looser stem socket

The stock cap's square stem socket is 1.95 mm for the 1.87 mm stem (Austin's calipers) and would
not push on. `tools/zezcap` opens it to 2.05 mm (`SOCKET`), same 1.8 mm depth, nothing else
changed. Output `case/zez0000/joystick_cap_v2.stl`. Print inbox drop `20260910-181311-joystick_cap_v2`,
on the PLA fit-check plate with base_v4.

### joystick_cap_v3 (2026-09-10): the v2 socket printed shut

The v2 cap came off the printer with the socket mouth squished and a sagged line across the
hole. Cause: the flange prints face down, so the 2 mm hole is in the squished first layer, and
its flat ceiling is a 2 mm bridge. `tools/zezcap` now cuts a 0.4 mm 45 degree chamfer at the
mouth (2.85 mm at the face) and a pyramid roof instead of the flat ceiling, and builds two
sizes: `joystick_cap_v3_2.05.stl` and `joystick_cap_v3_2.15.stl`. Both dropped for a slow PLA
print; keep whichever grips the 1.87 mm stem.

### Smaller joystick sockets and an X button (2026-09-10, later)

The v3 caps printed clean but the socket was loose on the stem. `tools/zezcap 1.95 2.00` builds
`joystick_cap_v3_1.95.stl` and `joystick_cap_v3_2.00.stl`, same chamfer and roof. `tools/zezbtn`
builds `button_cap_x.stl`: the stock (solid) button cap with a raised X on top, 0.7 mm bars at
45 degrees, 0.6 mm above the dome, for a cancel button. All three dropped for PLA, flange down.
`tools/zezbtn check` builds `button_cap_check.stl`, the confirm button, same raised bars in a
check mark. Later plan: print the symbols in a second color (green check, red X) on the AMS.
Result 2026-09-10 evening: socket 2.00 mm is the winner on the 1.87 mm stem. 10 copies queued.

### lid_v2 (2026-09-10): button holes moved

On the printed lid the four button holes sit 0.6 mm too far from the screen (the switch plunger
is off-centre in each hole) and are a hair tight on the caps. `tools/zezlid` fills the stock
holes, then cuts them 0.6 mm toward the screen (`SHIFT_X`) and 0.05 mm bigger per side (`GROW`).
Inside recess untouched. Output `case/zez0000/lid_v2.stl`. Queued with a base_v4 reprint as a
full case.


### lid_v3 (2026-09-10): button holes 0.3 mm bigger per side

lid_v2 printed with the holes lined up but tight, with print bumps catching the caps. The print
Claude opened the holes 0.3 mm per side directly on its copy of the v2 mesh (`lid_v2_holes_p06.stl`
on the Mac mini) and printed it in PETG. `tools/zezlid v3` makes the same part from source:
GROW 0.35 instead of 0.05, holes 5.20 x 4.45 mm on the same centres, x -24.25..-19.05. Output
`case/zez0000/lid_v3.stl`. Cap body is 4.30 x 3.56, so about 0.45 mm clearance per side.

### lid_v4 (2026-09-11): button holes halfway between v2 and v3

v3 (0.3 mm extra per side) was too loose. `tools/zezlid v4` uses GROW 0.20, holes 4.90 x 4.15 mm,
same centres. About 0.30 mm clearance per side on the 4.30 x 3.56 cap. Output `case/zez0000/lid_v4.stl`.
