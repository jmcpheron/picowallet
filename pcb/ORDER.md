# Test order — go through the motions (v0.7, 2026-09-23)

Goal: learn the process and the real clock. 5 boards, JLCPCB assembled, zero soldering: the board arrives with every part on it, you plug in the screen and the battery. Human does every click.

## Before you upload (10 min)

1. Open the 3D page and the copper image (`v0/render/pcb.png`). Look for anything dumb.
2. `v0/bom.csv`: one row has no part number on purpose: BT1 (the battery, drawn only). JLCPCB will flag it; skip it.
3. `v0/pick_and_place.csv`: same designator. Delete it if the uploader complains.
4. Buy separately: 5× 1.3" ST7789 240×240 **7-pin** module with pin header (Amazon B09QS544FX or MakerFocus B07P9X3L7M), 5× 402030 LiPo (20×30×4 mm, ~200 mAh) with protection board and JST-PH 2.0 plug.

## Upload

1. jlcpcb.com → Order now → drop `v0/fab.zip`. 2 layers, 1.6 mm, green, HASL is fine, qty 5.
2. Tick PCB Assembly. Both sides have parts, so it's "Standard" assembly. Assemble 5. Confirm the ~$50 setup line shows.
3. Upload `v0/bom.csv` and `v0/pick_and_place.csv`. Map columns if asked (Designator, Comment, Footprint, JLCPCB Part #).
4. Parts page: every row should match an LCSC number. Skip DISP1, BT1 and BP1. If the Pico 2 W (C42394205) is out of stock, stop and tell me: that's the one part with 68 in stock.
5. Placement preview: check the Pico is on the BOTTOM side with USB at the left edge, joystick is a diamond, switch pokes out the bottom.
6. Cart: note the tariff line (DDP, prepaid). Individuals can't pick DHL now; take the fastest option offered.
7. Screenshot the final quote before paying. Write the number and the promised dates below.

## Log

| Date | Step | Note |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-23 | quote v0.4 | $190.83 for 5 assembled. Superseded. |
| 2026-09-23 | quote v0.7 | **$221.55** for 5 assembled (PCB $4 + PCBA $217.55). 25/25 parts matched incl. the bare panel (JLCPCB places it, $3.59 ea) and the Pico. PCB 24 h, assembly 4–5 days. Cart project "fab_Y3", PCBA SMT026092460529. Superseded. |
| 2026-09-24 | quote v0.7b | **$221.24** for 5 assembled, cart item **fab_Y4** (PCBA SMT026092462580). Fixes after seeing JLCPCB's bottom preview: Pico moved to the left edge (was 6 mm inboard), Pico rotation set to 180 in the CPL so its USB faces the edge in JLCPCB's view, BT1 placeholder stripped from BOM/CPL (JLCPCB had merged it into a 100 nF cap). fab_Y3 deleted. |

## When it arrives

1. Fold the panel ribbon under its left edge, slide it into J3, flip the latch. Lay the panel flat.
2. Power over USB with the switch OFF. Check 3V3 on the ATECC VCC pin. Flash firmware, run `keytest.py`, map joystick directions.
3. Click the LiPo into J2 (red to BAT+), switch ON, unplug USB. Does it stay up. Plug USB back in, does the TP4056 get warm (charging).

## What happened 2026-09-23 (driven by Claude in a cloned Chrome, stopped at the address form)

- JLCPCB account created via "Sign in with Google" (austin.griffith@ethereum.org). Nothing paid.
- Gerbers accepted: 2 layer, 44×68 mm, 5 pcs, $4. Standard PCBA, both sides, qty 5, parts placement confirmation on. JLCPCB adds edge rails (board becomes 78×70 panel for their line).
- BOM: 16/17 matched automatically. BT1 (drawn battery) marked "do not place". Caught one bug on their table: R3 said 5.1k but carried the 2k part number; fixed to C23186 on the site and in the design.
- Quote breakdown: setup $51.50, stencil $16.54, fixture $16.54, X-ray $8.25, feeders $17.05, components $70.51 (Pico 2 W = $58.21 of that, $11.64 each), hand-solder $3.61, SMT $1.10, misc $2. Total $190.83.
- Placement preview (top) looked right. The Bottom tab would not open in the headless browser, so the Pico-on-bottom preview is NOT visually confirmed. The Pico is in the priced parts and the assembly is "Both Sides", so it is in the job. Check the Bottom tab yourself before paying.
- Screenshots: `v0/render/jlcpcb-quote.png`, `v0/render/jlcpcb-checkout.png`.

## To finish (you, ~5 min)
1. jlcpcb.com → cart → Secure Checkout. Enter shipping address (Individual Customer).
2. Pick shipping. Read the tariff line (DDP prepaid). Expect ~$30–45 shipping + ~$50–90 tariff on top of $190.83.
3. Open the PCBA item → Component Placements → Bottom. Confirm U1 (Pico) sits USB-left.
4. Pay. Write the number and dates in the log above.

## v0.7: uploaded 2026-09-23, in the cart
Switch overhangs the edge, PWR + CHG LEDs, bare 2" panel on an FPC latch with its own backlight driver, battery moved to the back. Board 82×44. JLCPCB matched the panel as a placeable part, so it ships ON the board. Gotcha hit twice: the quote page's "Both Sides" click silently reverts to Top/Economic and drops the Pico; always re-open "Change PCB specifications", click Standard + Both Sides, and confirm the order page says "Assembly Side: Both Sides" before uploading the BOM.

## Shopping list — everything the board does NOT come with
| Item | Qty | Where | ~USD |
|---|---|---|---|
| ~~Bare panel~~ JLCPCB places it (matched, $3.59 ea). Nothing to buy. | 0 | — | 0 |
| LiPo 402030, 200 mAh, 4 mm thick, protection board, JST-PH 2.0 plug | 5 | Amazon | 25 |
| Micro-USB cable, data not charge-only | 1 | you have these | 0 |
| M2.5 screws + standoffs for the case corners | a bag | Amazon | 8 |
That's it. Zero soldering, truly: the board arrives with every part on it. Screw the screen onto 4 standoffs, plug its cable into J1, click the battery into J2, flash the firmware over USB.

## CPL gotchas learned 2026-09-24
- tscircuit writes bottom-layer rotation with a mirror convention; JLCPCB rendered the Pico (pcbRotation 180 in the design, exported as 0) with its USB pointing INTO the board. Patched to 180 in `pick_and_place.csv` after export. Always look at JLCPCB's Bottom preview for any polarized bottom part.
- A BOM row with blank value/footprint (the drawn battery) gets merged into whatever row is above it. Strip placeholder parts from BOM + CPL before upload.
- JLCPCB's Edit Order on a cart item needs a real mouse click on the row; headless it never navigated. Fresh upload + delete the old item was faster.
| 2026-09-24 | quote v0.7c | **$221.37**, cart item **fab_Y6** (PCBA SMT026092560265). Changes: backlight 27 Ω, PROG 6.2 k, latch swapped to 1 mm AFC42 (C466532) and moved to (-4.3, 0.4) so the 20.7 mm ribbon lies flat. fab_Y4/Y5 deleted. Full dossier in `pcb/dossier/`. |
