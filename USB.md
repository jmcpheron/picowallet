# The wallet over USB

The USB wallet has no radio. It is a passive device: it never asks for anything. The website
(in Chrome, with WebSerial) pushes one message at a time down the USB cable, the wallet shows
what it was asked, the person presses A or Y, and the wallet answers. The app server keeps its
one job, relaying signed transfers and paying gas. Nothing else reaches the wallet.

```
browser (Chrome) ── WebSerial ── USB ── picowallet
   │  POST /api/requests (makes the request + digest)
   │  POST /api/requests/:id/signature (r, s)  ──▶ app server ──▶ relay ──▶ ChipAccount
```

## Framing

- One JSON object per line, `\n` terminated, UTF-8, on the Pico's USB serial port (the same
  port MicroPython uses for its REPL).
- Every host message carries an `id`. The wallet answers with the same `id`.
- Lines from the wallet that do not start with `{` are logs. Hosts ignore them.
- Lines longer than 16 KB are dropped with an `error`.
- The wallet handles one message at a time. A second `sign` while one is on screen gets
  `{"type":"busy"}` immediately.

## Messages

### hello

Host: `{"id": 1, "type": "hello"}`

Wallet:
```json
{"id": 1, "type": "hello", "name": "picowallet-pink", "fw": "usb-1",
 "serial": "0123597b4f22a25eee", "backend": "atecc608",
 "configLocked": true, "dataLocked": false, "hasKey": true,
 "qx": "0x…", "qy": "0x…", "address": "0x…"}
```
`qx`, `qy`, `address` are absent until the chip has a key. `address` is the P-256 key's
Ethereum-style address (keccak of the 64-byte public key, last 20 bytes), the same value the
website shows next to the account's blockie.

### sign

Host: `{"id": 2, "type": "sign", "request": { …WalletRequest… }}`

`request` is the object the app stores for `POST /api/requests`: `kind`, `chainId`, `account`,
`nonce`, `deadline`, `digest`, plus the kind's raw fields (`token`, `to`, `amount` for a
transfer; `name` for setName; `target`, `value`, `data` for execute) and display hints
(`toName`, `tokenSymbol`, `tokenDecimals`, `amountFormatted`, `valueFormatted`).

The wallet:
1. Rebuilds the EIP-712 digest from the raw fields. If it differs from `request.digest`, it
   answers `error` and shows nothing to sign.
2. Draws the request: summary page (what, how much, to whom), details page (full address in
   chunks, chain, nonce, deadline, vault), and the digest's blockie with its first 8 hex.
   Display hints are drawn smaller and never hashed.
3. Waits. A signs on the chip and answers `signature`. Y answers `rejected`.

Wallet answers, one of:
```json
{"id": 2, "type": "signature", "r": "0x…", "s": "0x…", "digest": "0x…"}
{"id": 2, "type": "rejected"}
{"id": 2, "type": "error", "error": "digest mismatch"}
{"id": 2, "type": "busy"}
```

The host then posts `r` and `s` to `POST /api/requests/:id/signature`, or `/reject`.

### cancel

Host: `{"id": 5, "type": "cancel"}`. Takes a pending `sign` off the wallet's screen (the person
changed their mind on the website). Wallet: `{"id": 5, "type": "cancelled"}`. The original
`sign` never gets an answer; the host drops it.

### provision

Host: `{"id": 3, "type": "provision", "op": "setup"}`, `"op": "lock-config"`, `"op": "genkey"`
or `"op": "status"`.

`status` answers at once with the chip's status. `setup` is the one people use: the wallet shows
a short explanation ("the chip makes the key right now, in front of you, nobody else ever sees
it, the chip locks to it for good"), A locks the config zone if needed and makes the key, and the
wallet then shows its new blockie and address. `lock-config` and `genkey` are the two halves on
their own. All three are permanent: allowed only when `secrets.py` sets `ALLOW_LOCK` /
`ALLOW_GENKEY`, and only after a physical A. Y cancels.

Wallet: `{"id": 3, "type": "result", "ok": true, "result": {"op", "note", "status", "hasKey", "qx", "qy", "address"}}`
or `{"id": 3, "type": "result", "ok": false, "error": "…"}`.

### state

Host: `{"id": 7, "type": "state", "vault": "0x…", "balance": "4", "symbol": "USDS"}` → Wallet:
`{"id": 7, "type": "ok"}`. A display hint, sent by the website whenever the balance changes.
The wallet shows it on its home screen labelled "per the website", and only when `vault` equals
its own pinned `EXPECTED_VAULT`. Nothing in it is trusted or signed.

The home screen shows the **vault** (the account that holds the money, from `EXPECTED_VAULT`)
as the big blockie and address, the balance hint under it, and the chip's own address small.
Without a pinned vault it shows the chip address and says so.

### ping

Host: `{"id": 4, "type": "ping"}` → Wallet: `{"id": 4, "type": "pong"}`.

### reboot

Host: `{"id": 6, "type": "reboot"}` → Wallet: `{"id": 6, "type": "rebooting"}`, then it resets and
comes back with `ready`. Use this instead of `mpremote ... machine.reset()`: killing mpremote
mid-reset has wedged the Mac's serial port twice, and only a replug clears that.

### Unsolicited

On boot the wallet prints `{"type": "ready", "name": "…"}` once.

## The comparison screen

The device exists so you can compare two screens before pressing A. Website and wallet draw
identical layouts from identical raw fields:

- the action and amount, large;
- the recipient: name hint (small, labelled) and the full address in 4 chunks of 10;
- the blockie of the digest (seed = `0x` + 64 lowercase hex), 8 cells, drawn big;
- the first 8 hex characters of the digest under it.

The website's blockie comes from the digest it got from the app. The wallet's blockie comes
from the digest it computed itself from the raw fields. If the two pictures match, the wallet is
signing what the website shows. `firmware/blockies.py` is a pixel-exact port of
`ethereum/blockies`; the website uses the same algorithm.

## What the wallet trusts

Nothing from the host. The chain id and vault address are pinned in `secrets.py`
(`EXPECTED_CHAIN_ID`, `EXPECTED_VAULT`, `EXPECTED_TOKEN`) when set. The digest is recomputed.
The key never leaves the chip. The host can only ask; the person decides.

## The website

`app/packages/nextjs`: a bar under the header with **connect** (WebSerial, Chrome or Edge) and
**connect emulator** (the virtual wallet on `localhost:4242`). Once connected the browser is the
courier: every request the site creates goes to the wallet, and the answer goes to the app. The
"Compare with the wallet" panel shows the wallet's own summary screen, the blockie and the 8 hex
while the wallet waits for A. The Setup page's lock and key buttons go over USB too.

- `services/usb/link.ts`: the two transports and the messages.
- `services/usb/blockies.ts`, `components/usb/Blockie.tsx`: the reference blockies algorithm.
- `components/usb/UsbWalletProvider.tsx`: connection state, `sign`, `cancel`, `provision`; it
  posts the wallet's key to `/api/device` so pairing works as before.
- `components/usb/ComparePanel.tsx`, `components/usb/UsbBar.tsx`: the UI.

## Development

- Emulator: `tools/emu run usbwallet`, then `tools/emu send '{"id":1,"type":"hello"}'` writes a
  line to the virtual device's stdin and prints what came back. `tools/emu headless usbwallet
  --send '…' --key A --shot x.png` scripts a whole session. The virtual wallet has a fixed
  throwaway software key, so a vault deployed on anvil against it keeps working across reboots
  (`CHIP_PUBKEY_X/Y` from its `hello`, `yarn deploy`).
- The website's **connect emulator** talks to the same virtual wallet through the emulator
  server (`POST /ctl/cmd {cmd: "send", waitId}`; the server allows cross-origin calls to `/ctl/`).
- Real board: `firmware/main_usb.py` goes on the board as `main.py`. `mpremote` still works:
  Ctrl-C drops the wallet loop to the REPL, and `tools/emu ship usbwallet` soft-resets first.
  Close the browser's connection before using `mpremote`; one process owns the port.
- The WiFi wallet (`wallet.py`) is unchanged. The USB wallet is `usbwallet.py`, sharing the
  signer, screen and EIP-712 code.
