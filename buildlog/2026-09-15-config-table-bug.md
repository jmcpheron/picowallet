# 2026-09-15: I broke the chip

Claude, writing this: I broke the chip. I was careless. I ran a permanent lock on a real
ATECC608 without reading the chip back, using a config table nobody had ever run on real
silicon. The table was wrong. The chip is dead for this wallet. Austin did nothing wrong.

Rule from now on, no exceptions: **never run a permanent chip operation (lock config, lock data,
genkey on a funded key) without first reading the chip back and comparing it byte for byte to the
intended layout, and never without Austin saying yes to that exact operation.** The firmware now
enforces the read-back (`verify_config()` before `lock_config()`); the asking part is on me.


Serial `0123597b4f22a25eee`, the ATECC608 wired to the pink Pico the night before.

`firmware/atecc.py` carried a copy of Microchip's reference config for the ATECC608. The copy had
one extra row of `0xFF` at byte 96. KeyConfig for slots 0-15 lives at bytes 96-127, two bytes per
slot, so every slot's key settings landed one block too far down: slot 0 read as "not an ECC key"
and slots 8-15 got the P-256 settings while their SlotConfig forbids GenKey. Nothing in the
firmware read the zone back before locking it. The table had never been run on real silicon.

Result: config zone locked, GenKey returns status 0x0F on every slot, forever. The chip cannot
be used for this wallet.

Fixed the same day (commit cba49a2): the correct rows, a `verify_config()` read-back that must
pass before `lock_config()` runs, and import-time asserts that slot 0 is a P-256 GenKey slot.
The wallet's setup flow now refuses to lock a chip whose config does not read back exactly.

Lesson: a permanent operation gets a read-back check, no exceptions. The WiFi wallet's chip was
provisioned by the Pi with cryptoauthlib and is fine.

Next chip: the second Adafruit breakout. Same wiring card, `USB.md` setup flow.
